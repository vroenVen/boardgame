# Kans
KANs work how they normally would in Riichi Mahjong, but the amount of KANs allowed as well as the 4-KAN abortion rule changes based on the player count.

| Player Count | # of KANs allowed | Rinshanpai in Dead Wall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 4 | 4 |
| 4 | 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 | 8 |

- Dora/Ura Dora count stays the same, but additional KANs are allowed based on player count
- A Rinshanpai is added based on the amount of KANs allowed
- 4-KAN abortion becomes n-KAN abortion when playing with 5 or more players
  - Ex. if playing with 7 players, and 7 KANs occur, the game ends in a draw due to 7-KAN abortion
- n-KAN abortion DOES NOT TRIGGER if a player is in TENPAI for Suukantsu (Four Quads)
- KAN can no longer be called if a player is in TENPAI for Suukantsu AND all Rinshanpai have been drawn from the dead wall.
