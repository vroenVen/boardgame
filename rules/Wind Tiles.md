# Ordinal Directions
In Maaaaaahjong, the ordinal directions (NE/NW/SE/SW) exist in the game. 

- a N/NW/W counts as a RUN, but honor restrictions/benefits apply (no all simples, counts for all honors)
- N/NW/NW counts as a NORTH triplet. Cardinal direction takes precedence (this means that SW/W/NW counts as a WEST triplet)
- The above means that you CANNOT call KAN on a wind run. (W/NW/N can't KAN SW/NE, SE/E/NE can't KAN S/N)
- The above means you CAN call KAN in certain scenarios. (NE/NE/N CAN KAN N/NE, but not E)
- NE/NE/NE is a honor triplet. If you KAN NE/NE/NE with N or E, it becomes the cardinal you kan it with.
- NE/NE/NE counts as an honor triplet/North Triplet/East Triplet/Wind Triplet for yaku purposes

## Seat Wind/Round Wind

Since Maaaaaahjong can be played with 3 to 8 players, seat wind and round wind are slightly adjusted.

Like in 3 player, winds whose seat is not in play can be called as KITA. The point values are adjusted based on how many tiles can be called this way.


| Player Count/Round Count | Seat Winds | Wind Kita Value (per tile) |
| ------------ | ------------- | --- |
| 3            | E, S, W       | 0.25 han |
| 4            | E, S, W, N    | 0.5 han |
| 5            | E, SE, S, W, N    | 0.5 han |
| 6            | E, SE, S, SW, W, N    | 1 han |
| 7            | E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N    | 1 han |
| 8            | E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE    | N/A |
